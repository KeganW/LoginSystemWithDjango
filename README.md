README
PURPOSE:Get more practice using django, learn how to create a login/logout page with functionality,
and experiment more with dynamic pages. These pages ultimately allow for a user to create an account,
login and logout. Errors will be displayed appropriately on the page. When the user is logged in, 
the create page will change.

WORK: Under login, modifications in urls.py and settings.py. Under login_system, views.py and urls.py. 
Under templates, create_user.html.j2 and login_page.html.j2. Under static, style.css. 

MOTIVATION: Never created a login/logout system, desire to learn more on dynamic pages, and desire
for more experience in working with databases and django. I hope to apply this in larger scale
projects.
